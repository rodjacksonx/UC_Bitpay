UC_BITPAY is a payment method module intended for use with version 6.x of Drupal, and version 2.x of Ubercart.

This module allows e-commerce merchants who have signed up with Bitpay (at https://bitpay.com) to use their API to accept bitcoins for online payments. The funds are converted by Bitpay to your local currency (in exchange for a fee) and a direct deposit is made into your bank. They currently allow deposits in: US Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Mexican Pesos, Eurozone Euros, British Pounds, Australian Dollars, New Zealand Dollars, Norwegian Kroner, Swedish Kroner, Danish Kroner, and South African Rand. Alternatively, they can simply forward the bitcoins to a bitcoin address of your choosing, for a much lower fee.
